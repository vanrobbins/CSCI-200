File Name: lab2LinearFunction2Points
Purpose: 
    This file finds and illustrates the slope intercept form of a function given two points. 
    It also finds and illustrates the X and Y-intercepts of the function.
Special Requirements: 
    It must use at least three types of variables, and define at least five variables. It must also use at least one mathmatical operation.
    All values must be stored in variables before they are used. The output must be a paragraph using at least four variables and computation result(s).
Variables Used In the Order of Creation:
    pointAX: Point A's x-value
    pointAY: Point A's y-value
    pointBX: Point B's x-value
    pointBY: Point B's y-value
    differenceY: Difference between point A's y-value and point B's y-value
    differenceX: Difference between point A's x-value and point B's x-value
    slope: Finds the slope of the two points
    yInterceptY: Finds the y intercept of the line or b value in y=mx+b
    xInterceptX: Finds the x intercept of the line or when y is equal to 0 in y=mx+b
    yInterceptX: The x value of the functions y-intercept or 0
    xInterceptY: The y value of the functions x-intercept or 0
    slopeIntEquation: The found equation given the two points or y=mx+b
    message: Final message that outputs the results
