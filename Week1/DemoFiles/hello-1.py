#Below are some examples of Python statements for getting familiar with Python codes
print('Hello, World!') #python doesn't require a semi colon at the end of each statement
print('Hello, World!!'); #most languages require a semi colon thus we will follow this convention
print("Hello, world!!!"); #both single quotes and doubles can be used to enclose some text
print("It's 4 o'clock US time."); #use quotes wisely when both are needed in a statement
print('The book is called "Think Python 2".');
print(2+1); print(2*2); print(4/7); #can do some math

print("\n"); #print a new line on the console
print("\n");

#Statement will run but will not output anything to the console screen if running statements like below in a script file
#typing a statement on the console will generate output
2+1;
type("Hello");
type(29);
type(2.9);


#Use print() to output results to the console screen.
#A function result can be used as an input to another function.
#The result of the type() function is used as an input to the print() function
#Remember the different data types of the input values below
print(type("5+1"));
print(type(29));
print(type(2.9));
print(type(4/7));

#Ctrl + d will close the console and thus a new run will generate a fresh console output


#Note: below are block comments, using triple quotes without indentation to enclose a large block of comments.

"""
1. double quotes and single quotes are used to enclose text values. They provide flexibility to print texts with quotes.
2. Although not required for Python, it is common practice to end a statement using a semi-colon, even if there is only one statement on the line.
3. When doing math, * is used for multiplications and / is used for divisions.
4. print() and type() are functions. A function takes an input and perform a particular taks. "()" must be used after the function name.
